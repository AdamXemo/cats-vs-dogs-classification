Convolution:
 Convolution is a *. We have kernel, for example 3, step on default=1, and 6x6
 picture. Our kernel design define a vertical edge detection because of its 
 values.
               |--> Convolution
 3 0 1 2 7 4   |
 1 5 8 9 3 1   |   1 0 -1       -5-4 0 8
 2 7 2 5 1 3   *   1 0 -1   => -10-2 2 3
 0 1 3 1 7 8       1 0 -1        0-2-4-7
 4 2 1 6 2 8       kernel       -3-2-3-16
 2 4 5 2 3 9       step=1



Max pooling:
 for examplpe 5x5 square of values. We have hyperparameters (not trainable)
 f=3 (filtersize) and s=1 (stride) and maybe p (padding) but ussualy dont use

 1 2 5 9 3                  we look at 3x3 (cuz f=3) square and take max value
 4 2 6 4 2        6 9 9     of it and we put this value to our new 3x3 square
 0 3 4 2 7   =>   6 7 7     and then we step 1 stride to right, put max value
 4 2 2 7 1        9 7 7     to our 3x3 square and we do this to have 3x3 square
 9 2 3 3 6                  with max values from 5x5 square. 

Average pooling:
 same example, f=3 and s=1. But this time we dont take max value from 3x3 square 
 in our 5x5 square, we take average value and put it inside of our 3x3 square.
